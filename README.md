🔐 Hill Cipher – C Implementation

    A simple implementation of the Hill Cipher encryption technique using a 3×3 matrix key, written in C.
📚 Overview

    The Hill Cipher is a classical encryption method based on matrix multiplication and modular arithmetic. This program allows encrypting and decrypting messages using a key matrix under modulo 26.
✅ Features

    3×3 matrix-based key system

    Encrypts and decrypts uppercase alphabetic text

    Handles spaces and auto-pads plaintext

    Validates key invertibility for decryption support
⚙️ Requirements

    C compiler (e.g., GCC)

    Terminal/command-line environment
🚀 How to Use

    Compile the program using any C compiler

    Input a 3×3 key matrix and plaintext

    View the resulting ciphertext and decrypted output
📌 Limitations

    Only supports uppercase letters (A–Z)

    Non-invertible matrices will not allow decryption

    Ignores non-alphabetic characters
